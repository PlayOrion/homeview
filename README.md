Homeview

	This is an AndroidTV 6.0 app designed to leverage an existing Plex server.  It is heavily influenced by the offical Plex AndroidTV app for UI and uses the Plex Rest API from serenity-android.  There is no licensing for this code.  Use my code however you want.  Licenses for any code/libraries I use are subject to their terms.  This is intended for my use only, but anyone may use or modify this as they see fit.
	
	
Currently there are a few unimplemented features as they are not relevent until I get any playback issues of video files fixed first.  Changes/fixes will come in the future.
